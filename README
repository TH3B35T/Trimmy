Trim My Clip

This tool allow you to playback a really long video that represent 24 hour or more from a satellite channel stream. It allows the user to select an area to cut from this long clip.
This tool was build to be used in two purposes;
Complying with ofgem law for live stream in UK, in short words for live stream TVs within UK you might get asked by government to prove the content you streamed incase you break the law or had a dispute with copyrights problem.
Remote Social media teams who needs to take some clips they will later publish on various social media platform.

This project can't run locally becaouse it wont work with backend server to playback the stream which is being loaded as Hls video on demand, and need also backend server which handel the requests that deal with trimming a small clip and allowing user to download it or delete it later.
It is considered as a single page app, you may review the code within this page: /src/views/Trimmy.vue
